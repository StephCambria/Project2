## Description

We all have to eat. Why not take the stress out of figuring out what to eat and what to buy? Have a lot of roommates and can’t remember what you already have? Or are you looking for something new and fresh to make? What's in the Fridge? is an app that trivializes these every day problems by keeping the contents of your fridge in one place, so you and your family, roommates, and other household companions can always know what's in the fridge!


## Installation

This application is deployed live through [Heroku!](https://what-s-in-the-fridge.herokuapp.com/)

## Usage

Currently, What's in the Fridge? is a web-only application, and is setting the framework for a much larger project. At the moment, users are able to view the contents of their fridge, find inspiration for new recipes, and organize grocery lists in a polished and secure application. Some of the upcoming features we are eager to implement are:

* different statuses / priorities for grocery items
* expiration dates
* a chat feature to encourage the collaborative family / roommate experience
* sorting food items and recipes by different categories or details (dairy free, show all recipes, import/create your own recipes)
* a more intuitive layout – have grocery and fridge lists on the same page, so you can drag/drop items from one list to the other
* and of course, a mobile version!
